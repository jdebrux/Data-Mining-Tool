# Decoding Hidden Patterns: A Comprehensive Data Mining and Visualisation Software Solution
This dissertation project focuses on the development of a data analysis tool suite that utilises a variety of data mining algorithms for complex data analysis. The software solution is built using the Python programming language and its relevant libraries, with a front-end user interface developed using React. The aim of the project is to provide a tool suite that can facilitate efficient data mining and visualisation for businesses and researchers respectively, regardless of their technical literacy. The project was successful in its aim to provide an effective tool suite for data analysis and visualisation, with the included data mining algorithms being optimised to achieve high levels of accuracy in a consistent manner.
