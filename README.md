# Decoding Hidden Patterns: A Comprehensive Data Mining and Visualisation Software Solution
This dissertation project focuses on the development of a data analysis tool suite that utilises a variety of data mining algorithms for complex data analysis. The software solution is built using the Python programming language and its relevant libraries, with a front-end user interface developed using React. The aim of the project is to provide a tool suite that can facilitate efficient data mining and visualisation for businesses and researchers respectively, regardless of their technical literacy.
